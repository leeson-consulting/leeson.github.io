I setup Leeson Consulting in 2013 to supply software R&D to the Otautahi (Christchurch) technical community.

My background is in electrical engineering with over 20 years experience in software R&D.
Over the years I have worked with Eaton, Tait, Trimble, Dynamic Controls, Enphase, and others
to help deliver their embedded / desktop / and web based products.

A smaller but no less important part of the business is providing Korean translation and interpreting services.
My wife 이강숙 (Kangsook) is a NAATI 3 accredited professional interpreter
and regularly assists with the GAP training courses run in support of Korean fishing companies based in Aotearoa (NZ).

The Blog contains technical and other musings on various topics.
Some of those musings get promoted into FOSS projects.

Feel free to look around.
