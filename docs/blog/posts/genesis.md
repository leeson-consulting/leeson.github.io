# Leeson Consulting

I setup Leeson Consulting in 2013 to purvey my services in product based engineering.
I'm an electrical engineer by degree and have over 20 years experience in software based R&D.
I've done work for Eaton, Tait, Caterpillar-Trimble, Dynamic Controls, and Enphase amongst others.

What I bring to the table is creativity and experience combined with an orthodox engineering mindset.

A smaller but no less important part of Leeson's business comes from Korean-English intepreting and translation.
My wife, 이강숙 (Kangsook Lee), is a NAATI 3 accredited professional intepreter,
and has over the last 15 years been involved with GAP training for Korean flagged vessels navigating Aotearoa's (NZ) waters.

We're based in Ōtautahi (Christchurch), which boasts temperate climes, an international airport, and a dedicated engineering community.

On a personal note, we're both Christians.
Our faith rests in המשיח ישוע (Yahshua Hamashiah).

We fall short of the mark just like everyone else,
but we choose to accept forgiveness and life promised by Yeshua to those who trust Him.

For a long time I've been afraid of what others might think.
The banner _hypocrite_ could rightfully be slung about my neck -
a dead albatross to haunt a dying marineer.

But this ship is not painted idle upon its melancholic ocean.
There are safer harbours ahead, and just as Peter could say "Lord Save Me!" so do I.
